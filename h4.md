## 1 Introduction
- Financial institutions serve as trusted third party to process electronic payments.
- Non-reversible transactions are not really possible.
- Merchants have to be mindful of their customers, hassling them for additional information to build trust.
- Fraud is unavoidable and accepted risk
- Solution to the double-spending problem to use a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions
## 2 Transactions
- Electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures.
- Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin
- A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.
- After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin
- Only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
- The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions
- The mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
publicly announced.
- We need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received
- Payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received
## 3 Timestamp Server
- A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash
- The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash
- Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain
## 4 Proof-of-Work
- The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits
- We implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.
- The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.
- Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.
- If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.
- To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
## 5 Network
- The network running steps:
1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the
chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
- Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it
- If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first.
- The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.
- Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages.
- If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.
## 6 Incentive
- The first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block
- This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation
- Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
- The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.
- Greedy attacker ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

Ka-ching!

# c) Giveway. and  d) Recycle.
- I think it would have been useful to have someone make test wallet so we would have had a prepared bitcoin wallet for the give away.
- There was an address to send the test coins so using that.

# e) Explorer. Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain. Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction, as a block can contain many transactions. Voluntary bonus: Use a transaction that's interesting, such as one related to a crime or other unusual event.

# f) RogeCoin. Critically comment on Honest Ads: If Cryptocurrency Was Honest (Video, about 5 minutes). Identify and list arguments made. Provide commentary to support and challenge each of the claims. If you can, provide references or real life examples to your claims. (This task does not require tests with a computer.)
1 Easy to lose and volatile
- The price varies and fraud is an accepted risk, but like stated in the video if banks fail the coins are still safe in the wallet. Volatility of the currency on the other hand...
- Bitcoin volatility last 30 days 2,226% - https://bitbo.io/volatility/
- Dollar volatility average month volatility 6,07% - https://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/volatility/VOL.DXY%3AFOREX-R.GARCH
2 Slaughters the environment
- Usage of electricity is troublesome, but there are people in nordic countries that have turned their mining rig into heating system saving them money and earning coins while doing so.
- Site that has information about using the waste energy from mining https://sunbit.fi/en/
3 Can't be exchanged for the vast majority of goods and services
- There are some services you can buy and if you really want to you can find a buyer and sell your coins in exchange of currency.
- There are over 250 companies and stores that accept crypto - https://bitpay.com/directory/
