## One-way functions.
- The notion of a one-way function is central to public-key cryptography.
- Easy to compute, but significantly harder to reverse
- Given x it is easy to compute f(x), but given f(x) it is hard to compute x.
- Can't use them for encryption as is.

## One-Way Hash Functions and its many names....
- ...compression function, contraction function, message digest, fingerprint, cryptographic checksum, message integrity check (MIC), and manipulation detection code (MDC)
- It is central to modern cryptography
- A one-way hash function is a hash function that works in one direction
- It is easy to compute a hash value from pre-image, but it is hard to generate a pre-image that hashes to a particular value. Hash function is not one-way.
- A good one-way hash function is also collision-free as it is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value.
- The hash function is public; there's no secrecy to the process.
- The security of a one-way hash function is its one-wayness.
- A single bit change in the pre-image changes the bits in the hash value
- A message authentication code (MAC) or data authentication code (DAC), is a one-way hash function with the addition of a secret key
- The hash value is a function of both the pre-image and the key

## HashCat
- Passwords are typically stored as hashes, which are one-way functions that cannot be reversed to reveal the original password.
- Attackers can use tools like Hashcat to attempt to crack these hashes by trying various combinations and comparing the results
- Hashcat can process millions of words per second, depending on the hardware. The results will show whether the password was successfully cracked or if the dictionary was exhausted without finding a match
- Ethical and Legal Considerations! It's crucial to note that using password cracking tools requires legal and ethical considerations.
- Users should only practice on their own systems or with explicit permission, and should be aware of local laws regarding penetration testing and security research
- To improving cracking speed, run Hashcat on the host OS rather than a virtual machine or use hardware with a powerful GPU, particularly with NVIDIA drivers and CUDA support
- NOTE! Password cracking should only be performed ethically and legally, such as for educational purposes or authorized security testing.

# a) Adding letters to hello for the 0 number in front of the hash

# b) Hash comparison
- Once I realised I had the wrong command...
- Literally changing one letter from the content makes the whole hash different.

- Okay nevermind it seemed to work... just that there was a ~ typo after the word so it didn't show in the first place.

# e) For the protection against dictionary attacks...
1. Use complex passwords with lower and uppercase latters, numbers and special characters.
2. Avoid using plain words as they are easy to crack with brute force dictionary attacks.
3. Better yet use a password manager to help you out.

- Ok I didn't quite get why the hashid didn't understand the hash. I believe it has something to do with special characters.

- Hah, test nr2 went way better.
- Did some googling and found https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes.

- File zlib-gst was unable to locate and it seems the rest didn't download, but managed to fix that by skipping it and hoping it will not bite me in the butt later.
