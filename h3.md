- Passwords are typically stored as hashes, which are one-way functions that cannot be reversed to reveal the original password.
- Attackers can use tools like Hashcat to attempt to crack these hashes by trying various combinations and comparing the results
- Hashcat can process millions of words per second, depending on the hardware. The results will show whether the password was successfully cracked or if the dictionary was exhausted without finding a match
- Ethical and Legal Considerations
- It's crucial to note that using password cracking tools requires legal and ethical considerations.
- Users should only practice on their own systems or with explicit permission, and should be aware of local laws regarding penetration testing and security research
- To improving cracking speed, run Hashcat on the host OS rather than a virtual machine or use hardware with a powerful GPU, particularly with NVIDIA drivers and CUDA support
- NOTE! Password cracking should only be performed ethically and legally, such as for educational purposes or authorized security testing.

- Once I realised I had the wrong commandm literally changing one letter from the content makes the whole hash different.

- Okay nevermind it seemed to work,, just that there was a ~ typo after the word so it didn't show in the first place.

- Ok I didn't quite get why the hashid didn't understand the hash. I believe it has something to do with special characters

- File zlib-gst was unable to locate and it seems the rest didn't download, but managed to fix that by skipping it and hoping it will not bite me in the butt later.
