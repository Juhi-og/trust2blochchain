- Uff did find some potentially good reviews, but just a bit dated. So wouldn't have found fresh articles under those.
- Adding year 2024 and searching again.
- Yes, it was not part of the homework, but taking you on this journey with me as it is the last homework.
- A lot of writen material about use of AI in cyber security, but not much luck finding 
- Ok 4th try is the charm.... ish, but didn't find a review...
- ...ok, not giving up, just steering my interests towards something I can actually find.
- Use of AI in cybersecurity it is

## A Systematic Literature Review of Information Security in Chatbots
- by Jing Yang, Yen-Lin Chen, Lip Yee Por and Chin Soon Ku
- Chatbots face multiple threats, including malicious inputs (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), user profiling attacks, contextual manipulations, and data breaches.
- There are evolving threats, like phishing through chatbots which lead to importance in continuous updates in security measures.
- Security requirements vary by domain, e.g., healthcare chatbots prioritize data privacy differently than financial or educational chatbots.
- Static and dynamic analysis of chatbot operations helps preemptively identify security and privacy issues.
- Advanced AI and machine learning algorithms should be developed to monitor and mitigate emerging threats.
- In ethical perspective, developing regulations and guidelines for chatbot deployment with clear ethical and legal standards.
- For security perspective a comprehensive assessments of chatbot architecture are critical.
- End users should be shared with awareness about safe chatbot interactions among users as a crucial importance.
- Usability vs security trade-offs must be carefully managed to provide secure yet user-friendly experiences.
