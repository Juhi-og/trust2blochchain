## Suppliers to the US government must fill a CISA attestation form
In effect since March 11, 2024  
Based on Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) by NIST  
Based on Secure by design principles

## NIS-2
Large impact on organisations  
- Increased supervision by authority
- Emphasis on risk management
- Reporting requirements  
  
Requirements are about the organisation's cybersecurity  
ISO-27001 - Information security  
- Supply chain security (ISO-27036)
- Vulnerability management (ISO-30111)
Also  
- Registration
- Reporting obligations

Industrial network is has extra protection and DMZ should be hard for the attacker to reach.  
Ideally the industry zone has no connection to internet. There are still things that need updating etc that keep things interesting and hard to solve.  
Cloud Where to put it 1, 2.... or 3?
## NIS-2 vs CRA
Both aim to enhance organizational and product-level cybersecurity but differ in their scope:  
NIS-2: Targets organizational practices.  
CRA: Focuses on digital product security.

There was a lot of information and I was not able to catch all of it, but luckily remembered to take screenshots.   

## Questions:
How do organizations manage compliance with overlapping regulations like NIS-2 and CRA?  
Are there emerging technologies or frameworks that simplify compliance with these regulations?  
What role does international collaboration play in harmonizing cybersecurity standards across regions?

This panel as a blast and I was completely captivated by the presentation!  
## Questions:
How will the mandatory CRA vulnerability notification process impact product development timelines?  
What industries are most affected by the upcoming CRA vulnerability notification requirements?  
## Idea
A tool for automated CRA vulnerability notifications to simplify the compliance process starting in 2026.
