## Suppliers to the US government must fill a CISA attestation form
In effect since March 11, 2024  
Based on Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) by NIST  
Based on Secure by design principles  
https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form  
## NIS-2
Large impact on organisations  
- Increased supervision by authority
- Emphasis on risk management
- Reporting requirements  
  
Requirements are about the organisation's cybersecurity  
ISO-27001 - Information security  
- Supply chain security (ISO-27036)
- Vulnerability management (ISO-30111)
Also  
- Registration
- Reporting obligations

Industrial network is has extra protection and DMZ should be hard for the attacker to reach.  
Ideally the industry zone has no connection to internet.  
There are still things that need updating etc that keep things interesting and hard to solve.  
Cloud connection... Where to put it 1, 2 or 3?  

## NIS-2 vs CRA
Both aim to enhance organizational and product-level cybersecurity but differ in their scope:  
NIS-2: Targets organizational practices.  
CRA: Focuses on digital product security.  

**NIS-2**  
Keep your house in order  
Don't buy stuff in the garage sale  
  
**CRA**  
Don't mess up someone else's house  
Don't sell bad stuff to the customer  
NOTE! We need a certifiable  standard to address the CRA!

## EU Legislation - New Legislative Framework
New legislative frameworks align with modular and standardized approaches

## Standards for AI  
ISO/IEC 42001:2023  
ENISA - Multilayer Framework for Good Cybersecurity Practices for AI  
ENISA - Generative AI cybersecurity assessment report (to be published)  
ETSI - Secure Artificial Intelligence Technical Committee  
NIST - Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework  
  
There was a lot of information and I was not able to catch all of it, but luckily remembered to take screenshots.   

## Questions:
How do organizations manage compliance with overlapping regulations like NIS-2 and CRA?  
Are there emerging technologies or frameworks that simplify compliance with these regulations?  
What role does international collaboration play in harmonizing cybersecurity standards across regions?

## RED
RED - Radio Equipment Directive  
Checklist to pass RED part 1  
Standards and regulations governing the cybersecurity aspects of radio equipment.  
1. Software updates are enforced?
2. Device storage is secure?
3. No vulnerabilities?
4. Password are unique or strong? 
 
**Checklist to pass RED part 2  **
Specific requirements for secure product development and operations in compliance with RED and CRA.
1. All sensors that may affect user's privacy are documented?
2. User is notified if protection or privacy of personal information is altered?
3. 3rd party access to personal information is denied by default?
4. User or authorized party can delete all personal information, passwords and other security information?


## Implementations and Issues  
A practical demonstration of device vulnerabilities, focusing on physical and software-based testing methodologies.  
90% use TLS and cert pinning  
80% implemented on baremetal (no OS)  
66% us wifi for communication  
90% are online only temporarely  

Most common issues  
Data not removed  
Sharing privacy information with 3rd party  
Complex manufacturing, seller does not know how device works

This panel as a blast and I was completely captivated by the presentation!  
## Questions:
How will the mandatory CRA vulnerability notification process impact product development timelines?  
What industries are most affected by the upcoming CRA vulnerability notification requirements?  
## Idea
A tool for automated CRA vulnerability notifications to simplify the compliance process starting in 2026.
