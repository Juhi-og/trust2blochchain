# H1 c) Install Debian on Virtualbox. Report your work, including the environment (including host OS, the real physical computer used), the steps you took and their results.
Started with the installation and was hoping there wuold be enough time and energy to dig into the other assingments.

Using my main laptop for the virtualbox just incase I need to do things while traveling.
This one is ROG Strix G733CW, CPU: i9-12950HX with ~2.3GHz, RAM: 32 GB, GPU: GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 16GB and Operating system: Windows 11 Pro 64-version.

I had some initial problems with getting the virtualbox to instal Debian, but third time was the charm.
Classically making a password took a while, just so I could be sure I got it backed up in secure location in case I forget it.
Otherwise first parts of the installation went smoothly.
When restarting for the first time, I got some error message, but seemed to work non the less.
Easy to follow guide was definately a help. I have tried to get into running Linux on some back up computer or secondary rig I have had at hand, but it has been quite a struggle.
I suppose the biggest hurdle has been the reasaon to do so. Just for "educational" purpose to tinker around when I have time have not been fruitful.
Now that there is actually a meaning to do so is fun.


# H1 a) How would you compare Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK Enterprise matrix? Who do you think could benefit from these models?

# H1 b) Pick a security incident and learn about it. Write briefly about it. Point out the concepts of threat actor, exploit, vulnerability and (business) impact. (You can find writeups about security incidents from Darknet Diaries and Krebs)
 

# H1 Voluntary assingments
Will get back to these and write about them a bit later.
# H1 d) Voluntary bonus: Use either (Hutchins et al 2011) cyber kill chain or MITRE ATT&CK framework for analyzing a security incident. You can pick any incident you want (even the one you used earlier in this homework), but try to pick a source that gives you enough technical and business detail to do some analysis.

# H1 e) Voluntary bonus: What do you consider the fundamentals of security? What are the theoretical foundations you would teach on the first day?

# H1 f) Voluntary bonus: Do you think anything is missing from these models, Cyber Kill Chain or MITRE ATT&CK?
