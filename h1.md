# X) Read and summarize
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Evolves with repeatable intrusion attempts, building on successes and failures.
- Computer Network Defense (CND). Risk management strategy that addresses the treat component of risk. Requires understanding of intrusions themselves as phased progression. Continuous process to discover new activity with new leverage indicators.
- Defender needs to implement countermeasures faster than adversary to make their work as costly as possible. I think this will likely include some business decisions on defenders end.
- Learning from repeated intrusion attempts helps to deal with future attempts and finding identification patterns can link into wider spread campaigns.
- Indicators: Atomic, computed and behavioral
- Indicator life cycle and transitions: Report -> Revealed -> Leverage -> Mature -> Discover -> Utilized -> Analyzed -> Revealed...
- Kill chain: The new way to analyze intrusions as the old ones are not enough anymore. Requires many attributes from each phase to form best options for courses of action. Prior phases before intrusion attempt need to be analyzed completely.
- Defender has to be able to move detection and analysis in the kill chain in addition to be able to implement courses of action.
- Collecting data from intrusion attempts is essential to find the tools, technology and processes adversary uses.
- Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP). Campaign analysis to find patterns and behaviors of the intruders.

## Explain "tactic", "technique" and "procedure" in context of ATT&CK, and give an example of each.
- Tactics are the reason for performing an action. For example	Execution	- The adversary is trying to run malicious code. 
- Techniques are how goal is achieved. For example JavaScript	- Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution.
- Procedures are chain of ways to use. For example 	Astaroth (Trojan and information stealer) -	Astaroth uses JavaScript to perform its core functionalities.

## EP 90: Jenny
- Jenny has been working as a social engineer doing physical penetration testing to break into buildings for over 30 years.
- Learned to use brains over brawn at young age to get into buildings. Picking targets from abandoned building and moving into buildings that wasn't abandoned.
- Using people skills to provide access for later on entries.
- Innocent looking females were a new thing in the industry, which helped her a lot in the early days.
- First solo job was eye opening about how relax the security was.
- Jenny nowdays has different sort of props, teams of people and multiple plans for each job.
- Information gathering from social media is a thing that helped a lot and it was a definate game changer.
- Indirect information from targets secretary or employees can provide a lead to build on.
- Rush is essential to not let the mark think.
- Essentials for social engineering is ability to think on your feet and react fast.

# A) How would you compare Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK Enterprise matrix? 
- Cyber kill chain is simpler and easier to explain model. Keeping things simple is fast and easy to understand way. I think this way would be easier to explain business desicions, risk control and where to invest.
- ATT&CK Enterpice matrix is way more detailed and having more of a information bank to churn out ways to find course to actions.
- Cyber Kill Chain I would introduce to most of the employees working with computers to raise awareness in first couple 3. steps Reconnaissance, Weaponization and Delivery to help recognize and report them. Enterprise matrix on the other hand I would show to IT department, programmers and developers.

# B) Pick a security incident and learn about it.
- This is a direct copy of the first paragraph of the incident report: Security consulting giant Kroll disclosed today that a SIM-swapping attack against one of its employees led to the theft of user information for multiple cryptocurrency platforms that are relying on Kroll services in their ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. And there are indications that fraudsters may already be exploiting the stolen data in phishing attacks.
- Idea behind the attack is to reset a password with access to a phonenumber linked in the accounts that can provide valuable data. In this case BlockFi, FTX and Genesis customers that use T-Mobile employee phones. Without proper checking of credentials or authority to do so multiple SIM-swapping gangs were able to access user informations and other data. SIM swapping can be mixed up with phishing scams to call other employess with company number to make the calls more trustworthy and direct them to visit phishing websites to steal login information etc. Business impact of the SIM swapping can be huge.
- Losing control over your phone number can have devastating effects since it is so widely spread in identification usage.

# C) Install Debian on Virtualbox.
Using my main laptop for the virtualbox just incase I need to do things while traveling.
This one is ROG Strix G733CW, CPU: i9-12950HX with ~2.3GHz, RAM: 32 GB, GPU: GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 16GB and Operating system: Windows 11 Pro 64-version.

I had some initial problems with getting the virtualbox to instal Debian, but third time was the charm.
Classically making a password took a while, just so I could be sure I got it backed up in secure location in case I forget it.
Otherwise first parts of the installation went smoothly.
When restarting for the first time, I got some error message, but seemed to work non the less.
Easy to follow guide was definately a help. I have tried to get into running Linux on some back up computer or secondary rig I have had at hand, but it has been quite a struggle.
I suppose the biggest hurdle has been the reasaon to do so. Just for "educational" purpose to tinker around when I have time have not been fruitful.
Now that there is actually a meaning to do so is fun.
