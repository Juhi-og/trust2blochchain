# x) Summarize.


## NOTE
In Finland, it's legal to use TOR at the time of writing.  
If you reside in another juristiction, laws might be different.  
Obviously, it's illegal to do illegal things in TOR, just like it's illegal to do illegal things anywhere.  
Only do legal things.  
  
# a) Install Tor browser
Downloading the TAR  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e540f72a-dc18-47e1-9788-d3cc7afc8601)
Made folder and extracted files...  with the the app in Debian  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c82480e4-7015-4c8b-b664-27aae50aff46)
located the folder  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8deec698-d08b-45cb-8266-5e04c368d024)
hmm forgot what the execute command was... most likely sudo... anywho figured I would open the file from the folder

Untrusted Warnings and launch anyway  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8480498-2a0c-49ea-860e-2279d78c1ffe)
There we go  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5f4aff-ff47-4f61-af8c-50d19d25011f)
Connecting...   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65310fa9-3c08-4221-a136-efc2a9ca4149)
And then for the life of me can't remember what was the search engine. Duckduckgo not being helpful. There was option to onionize, so checking that out.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9523a49e-5ec4-45e9-90c2-0c30baf5bd9b)
Going back and testing this one  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/979efcf8-fb6b-4f15-bee7-010b83165725)
And it is loading at least.  
On a side note and hat tipping... I Have to say someone did spend some time to get those duckduckgo in front of that hash  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b09f2dd-2b89-4a2a-9c52-244c11658fb8)
That rabbit hole didn't lead to forward so searched for another search engine...  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65c0e267-761a-4649-9a6e-c26141392623)
This one has onion network button, so lets dig in  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1820c1f7-cf47-4978-b8ad-80d2ec3b0638)
Seemed to do the trick  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c2c8cb-b103-4ce4-936b-f2dcc55d2d30)
After that remembered the word! AHMIA!  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e06d544-af6d-4e1d-94fe-ee5944f4fc7c)
That's more like it  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c58e562-161d-4a15-b16f-6a28aedd9442)
Switched to onion site and lets get searching going  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2416cc81-6c30-4b72-890f-ad1ee51c497e)
And there we go, searched for markets and at Venus Marketplace

# b) Browse TOR network
## Search engine
Did a little bit of Googling and found another search engine. Haystack being mentioned at list by Avast.

## Human rights or civil rights organization
Going for Amnesty first to see what I can find  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a718b73-6dfc-4f83-8a4a-228720a02ad2)
Found a link to article about Pegasus project  
(quote)Amnesty International and the media platform Forbidden Stories have published an investigation into the use of an Israeli tool to spy on many people in the world. The investigation was called the Pegasus Project.(/quote)  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e26bae2a-20fd-45f0-b6d0-b9689792c55b)
Nothing with Red cross a little surprisingly nothing with Green Peace... but after writing it correctly "greenpeace" got some hits.  
Freedom of press found foundation I believe was a good find in the end!

## Market place
Okay, so I opened a Venus Marketplace site already so continuing browsing there.  
Not really sure if surprised about the amount of things available. Defenately eye opening and most things like phones and computers make sense.  
Tried to find another market place, but some links with reasonable amount of descriptions didn't open and there were mane "amazon" sites that I didn't spend much time on.

## Fraud
Did not have much luck with Fraud. Did find in the end a site to help out scam wictims, which was a bit sketchy.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2a46bc7-af47-4d22-b307-09721e5dfa87)
Fraud as a service did get more hits and sites that actually work.  
For example Hacker services to recover lost access to social media account.

## Forum
Took a while to hammer out some words to find good hits for sites.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc577346-0704-4d91-905f-bb7072d5153a)
After the end found a list and links to several forums

## Well known organization
I think Freedom of press found foundation covers this one, but searching for another just in case.
