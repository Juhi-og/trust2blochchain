# x) Summarize.
## Dingledine, Mathewson and Syverson 2004:  Tor: The second-generation onion router.
1. Goals - Prioritize frustrating traffic analysis and traffic confirmation attempts.
- Deployability - Must be cost-effective and practical to operate. Should avoid requiring complex changes, such as kernel patches or specific protocols. Minimize dependency on non-anonymous entities (e.g., websites running additional software).
- Usability - User-friendly to attract more users, which strengthens anonymity (more users = more anonymity). Minimize delays and avoid requiring technical changes to user systems. Works across multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.
- Flexibility - Serve as a platform for future research in low-latency anonymity networks. Support solutions to open issues like dummy traffic or Sybil attacks.
- Simplicity -  Design should be easy to understand, deploy, and analyze for security. Avoid unproven or complex features that can compromise stability and security.
2. Non-Goals of Tor Design
- Not Peer-to-Peer - Tor doesn't aim to be a decentralized peer-to-peer system like other anonymity designs (e.g., Tarzan or MorphMix).
- No End-to-End Attack Protection - Tor isn't designed to completely prevent timing or intersection attacks that link users to their communication partners.
- No Protocol Normalization - Tor doesn't clean up differences in protocol behavior (e.g., HTTP quirks) for anonymity; external tools like Privoxy are required.
- Not Steganographic - Tor doesn't hide the fact that a user is connected to the Tor network.
3. Threat Model
- Assumptions about the Adversary - The adversary can observe some network traffic and compromise some routers. Can actively generate, modify, or delay traffic to introduce identifiable patterns. Can subvert directory servers or disrupt the network to flush users to less secure systems.
- Adversary Goals - Link a user (Alice) to her communication partners. Build behavioral profiles based on traffic patterns. Exploit passive attacks (e.g., correlating packet timing and volume) or active attacks (e.g., manipulating traffic or nodes).
- TOR's Defense Focus - Prevent traffic analysis attacks rather than complete protection against all traffic confirmation techniques. Maintain reliability to prevent adversaries from forcing users to switch to less secure systems.

## Karunanayake, Ahmed, Malaney, Islam and Jha 2021: De-anonymisation attacks on tor: A survey. 
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms over the Internet are all the more important for whistle-blowers and citizens of totalitarian governments.
- Anonymous networks include sensitive communications of military and business organisations over the public Internet
- The Onion Router project aka TOR is the most popular low latency anonymity network to date
- Tor being an anonymity network, the most common objective of a Tor attack is to de-anonymise its users and services through de-anonymisation attacks
- Circuit Establishment uses encryption and multiple relays (entry, middle, exit) to anonymize traffic.
- Survey covering over 30 de-anonymization attacks, including recent methods like deep learning.
- Introduces a new multi-level taxonomy to classify attacks based on execution methods and Tor components.
- TOR's growth and security improvements have mitigated many legacy attacks.
- Newer attacks, especially those using advanced technologies, remain a concern.
- Provides recommendations for researchers and future developments in anonymity technologies.

- Side channel and Hybrid seem to be most covered with de-anonymization techniques.
- Controlling Entry and Exit routers seem difficult, simular to controlling a singe TOR node, but the combination of those seem to be the way to go.

## Halonen, Ollikainen, Rajala 2023
- The PhishSticks USB drive is delivered to location or premesis manually, dropped on the floor or send by snail mail
- Unaware person attaches the USB to their computer
- Pre-recorded keystrokes are delivered into power-shell where the payload is downloaded
- PhisSticks is recording all keystrokes and every account logged in are now compromized
- Data is delivered to attacker by HTTP POST, so attack can be anywhere

## NOTE
In Finland, it's legal to use TOR at the time of writing.  
If you reside in another juristiction, laws might be different.  
Obviously, it's illegal to do illegal things in TOR, just like it's illegal to do illegal things anywhere.  
Only do legal things.  
  
# a) Install Tor browser
Downloading the TAR  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e540f72a-dc18-47e1-9788-d3cc7afc8601)  
Made folder and extracted files...  with the the app in Debian  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c82480e4-7015-4c8b-b664-27aae50aff46)  
located the folder  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8deec698-d08b-45cb-8266-5e04c368d024)  
hmm forgot what the execute command was... most likely sudo... anywho figured I would open the file from the folder  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7188c85a-b877-4435-89bd-9276b21f75d4)  
Untrusted Warnings and launch anyway  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8480498-2a0c-49ea-860e-2279d78c1ffe)  
There we go  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5f4aff-ff47-4f61-af8c-50d19d25011f)  
Connecting...   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65310fa9-3c08-4221-a136-efc2a9ca4149)  
And then for the life of me can't remember what was the search engine. Duckduckgo not being helpful. There was option to onionize, so checking that out.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9523a49e-5ec4-45e9-90c2-0c30baf5bd9b)  
Going back and testing this one  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/979efcf8-fb6b-4f15-bee7-010b83165725)  
And it is loading at least.  
On a side note and hat tipping... I Have to say someone did spend some time to get those duckduckgo in front of that hash  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b09f2dd-2b89-4a2a-9c52-244c11658fb8)  
That rabbit hole didn't lead to forward so searched for another search engine...  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65c0e267-761a-4649-9a6e-c26141392623)  
This one has onion network button, so lets dig in  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1820c1f7-cf47-4978-b8ad-80d2ec3b0638)  
Seemed to do the trick  
At least giving proper urls.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c2c8cb-b103-4ce4-936b-f2dcc55d2d30)  
After that I remembered the word! AHMIA!  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e06d544-af6d-4e1d-94fe-ee5944f4fc7c)  
That's more like it  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c58e562-161d-4a15-b16f-6a28aedd9442)  
Switched to onion site and lets get searching going  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2416cc81-6c30-4b72-890f-ad1ee51c497e)  
And there we go  
Searched for markets  
and accessed Venus Marketplace  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b82ae126-d384-4d80-943b-f7684fd6f8fb)  

# b) Browse TOR network
## Search engine
Did a little bit of Googling and found another search engine. Haystack being mentioned at list by Avast.  
https://www.avast.com/c-best-dark-web-search-engines  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/683dbecd-c196-4d1c-9633-12aa26f3a5c7)

## Human rights or civil rights organization
Going for Amnesty first to see what I can find  
Found a link to article about Pegasus project  
(quote)Amnesty International and the media platform Forbidden Stories have published an investigation into the use of an Israeli tool to spy on many people in the world. The investigation was called the Pegasus Project.(/quote)  
Interesting stuff, will have to read about that later.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e26bae2a-20fd-45f0-b6d0-b9689792c55b)  
Nothing with Red cross a little surprisingly nothing with Green Peace... but after writing it correctly "greenpeace" got some hits.  
Freedom of press found foundation I believe was a good find in the end!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a376b378-b366-4cea-8e02-de0ca5189fe2)

## Market place
Okay, so I opened a Venus Marketplace site already so continuing browsing there.  
Not really sure if surprised about the amount of things available. Defenately eye opening and most things like phones and computers make sense.  
Tried to find another market place, but some links with reasonable amount of descriptions didn't open and there were mane "amazon" sites that I didn't spend much time on.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b82ae126-d384-4d80-943b-f7684fd6f8fb)

## Fraud
Did not have much luck with Fraud. Did find in the end a site to help out scam wictims, which was a bit sketchy.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2a46bc7-af47-4d22-b307-09721e5dfa87)  
Fraud as a service did get more hits and sites that actually work.  
For example Hacker services to recover lost access to social media account.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dba9f58-d381-48af-9878-d7ef01eaa17b)

## Forum
Took a while to hammer out some words to find good hits for sites.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc577346-0704-4d91-905f-bb7072d5153a)  
After the end found a list and links to several forums  
http://wkkrcvjmihnluslrubketrt3uizkfhajw7gvzm24bxuvgs6hd43zkpyd.onion/onion-blogs-forums-chats-v3  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c507a4-5c1c-4ddf-a847-3249c6153522)  


## Well known organization
I think Freedom of press found foundation covers this one, but searching for another just in case.  

There we go, took a little while but there is BBC news in TOR.  
https://www.bbcnewsd73hkzno2ini43t4gblxvycyac5aw4gnv7t2rccijh7745uqd.onion/

# c) Onion
## Anonymity
- TOR anonymizes your connection by routing your traffic through multiple encrypted relays (Entry, Middle, Exit).
- Your browser builds circuit of relays which are chosen randomly
- Entry Node, Knows who you are (your IP address) but not where you're going.
- Middle Node, Only knows the previous and next relay in the chain, acting as a bridge.
- Exit Node, Knows the final destination but not who you are.
- As you browse: 
- Entry Node, Removes its encryption layer and forwards the data to the Middle Node.
- Middle Node, Removes its encryption layer and forwards the data to the Exit Node.
- Exit Node, Removes the final layer and sends the original data to the destination.
## Encryption and algorithms
- TOR uses asymmetric encryption for securely creating circuits, and symmetric encryption for transmitting data.
- Algorithms used are at least RSA and AES to ensure security and anonymity
- 
# d) TOR Thread model
TOR can help attackers in:
- Reconnaissance, giving access to forums and tools to research vulnerabilities
- Weaponizations, a potential source to aquire attack tools
- Delivery/Exploitatio/Installation, TOR hosted hidden services and sites may be used to download malware in a phishing campaigns 
- C2, providing a secure communication channel with compromised systems
- Actions on Objectives, commonly used as a medium for ransom payments

# e) PhishSticks
- PhishSticks do work. There is a reason why companies have taken the IT security seriously, but sadly there are still many who disregard the importance of security protocols.  
- Social engineering can do marvels and there are weak points to every company. The bigger companies tend to have better grasp on securite, but a lot of employees mean that people come and go. So things can get too relaxed if there are not enough reminders about it. Smaller companies working under or in closely with bigger companies can be easier targets as a proxy to gain access this way.  
- PhishSticks as a delivery mechanic can be hidden inside another device and once the backdoor has been created or access to systems gained, it can lead into another kind of attack on the systems.
- Against PhishSticks I believe the best way to mitigate it is to remind people not to hook anything to work computers or network. Even if they want to recharge the battery of their phone or smartdevice, as they too can act as a delivery mechanism.
