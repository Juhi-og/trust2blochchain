# X) Read and summarize
- Names used in a purpose to explain the participants in use of protocols
- Alice - First participant in all the protocols
- Bob - Second participant in all the protocols
- Carol - Participant in the three- and four-party protocols
- Dave - Participant in the four-party protocols
- Eve - Eavesdropper - Hard to detect
- Mallory - Malicious active attacker - Easier to detect because of the activity
- Trent - Trusted arbitrator
- Walter - Warden; he'll be guarding Alice and Bob in some protocols
- Peggy - Prover
- Victor - Verifier
- In symmetric cryptography both participants choose the same cryptosystem and key.

## In public-key cryptography both participants choose the same croptosystem and both have 2 keys.
- Key and safe comparison is fitting when explaining the pubkey. Safe being the information that needs to be secured. I would explain pubkeys so that a person creates two keys. One only locks the safe, but can be used by anyone and the other key only opens the safe, but is only hold be the creater.
- In other words anyone with the public key can encrypt a message with it but not decrypt it, but only the person with the private key can decrypt message ecrypted with the private-key.
- How to deliver the public-key can be tricky. For example posting it on website, means it can be vulnerable for hacking. Saying it out loud on the phone and someone else can hear it. It really feeds the paranoia, but there are not really safe ways to send it.
- This is where network choosing the same cryptosystems together and posts all the public keys into a database. This shortens the needed interaction between Bob and Alice.
- Hybrid cryptosystem introduces session keys used with symmetric algorithms to secure messages. After the initial contact from Bob. Alice generates a random session key and encrypts it with Bobs public key and sends it to Bob. When Bob decrypts Alices message he can encrypt the message with the additional session key.

## Digital signatures.
- Step 1 preparation. Alice hands Bob the public key to make sure Bob knows it is Alices.
- Step 2 signing. Alice sends signed picture and uses her private key to encrypt the signature. Then sends the message and picture to Bob.
- Step 3 verifying. Bob receives the mail and wants to verify the picture. Bob uses Alices publick key and digital signature in the email and the picture. If the picture or signature has changed the verification fails.
## Improving cookie token security
- 1 John prepares by generating a key pair. John keeps the private key secret and hands the public key over to Lisa. This is a one-time setup step.
- 2 John wants a cookie. He writes a message and signs it with his private key. He sends the message and the digital signature in an email to Lisa.
- 3 Lisa verifies the signature of the message using Johnâ€™s public key and updates the spreadsheet.

# a) Pubkey today.
- I use WhatsApp in day to day basis and sending private messages in it counts towarsd the pubkey usage. WhatsApp has accounts that are tied to phonenumber and the private messages encrypted.
- Reference: https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543

- WhatsApp has 2 new components added in 2023 for key transparency. (Text below copied from https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/)
- 1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.
- 2. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.
- With these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically.

# b) Messaging.
- The task: "Send an encrypted and signed message using PGP, then verify and decrypt it."

# d) Eve and Mallory.
- Eve has hard time because the algorithm is considered as unbreakable. Even if Eve manages to listen and gather the encrypted messages send, she can't decrypt them without the private keys.
- Mallory likewise would need to break the algorithm to be able to change the content of the messages.
Struggling with this part.... Be specific what features, which use of keys and which flags in the command are related to this protection.

# f) Password management.
- Chrome webbrowser has build in strong password suggestion and saving. It is helpful for normal user since login in with same account to pc and mobilephone gives access to same vault for passwords.
- When making a new account to a site, Chrome suggest complicated password which is automatically saved if the succestion is accepted.
- Or if you choose to pick one yourself, Chrome gives you prompt asking to save the password?
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7f312c-7674-455a-862c-47e38af96f8b)
- Also if you have changed your password the prompt will ask if you would like to update the password?
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df81ddcc-3373-43e4-8c03-e08190c5a2d7)
- When you open the webpage again. Login information to site saved in Chrome. Username and password automatically added when page opened.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41fadac-823e-4583-b170-85874f22a5fa)
- Password manager page, that is linked to your Google account.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f9a3160-44f6-4432-b73a-e833e2cd90f3)
- Choosing to edit saved password or account name askes for permissions to login detais for the pc you are using and depending on if you have authorised biometric autentication a thumbprint or pincode in mobilephones.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b50fd36a-f021-4e08-bac0-721edb63e170)
- Then you can edit the username, show the password, delete or share it if needed
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21f1aed-e806-4b41-a851-83003221d305)

- There is also the downside of having multiple devices where you have logged in so there is a bigger risk to get hacked in one way or the other. The stronger the password, he harder it is to pass by but also to remember. So that is where the password managers come handy.
- Passwords you can keep in your mind tend not to be that complex and so-forth easier to be penetrated. Bruteforce attacks take advantage of easy passwords and run leaked and common passwords against leaked login names to penetrate login for other sites.
