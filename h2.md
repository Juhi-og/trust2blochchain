# a) Pubkey today.
I use WhatsApp in day to day basis and sending private messages in it counts towarsd the pubkey usage. WhatsApp has accounts that are tied to phonenumber and the private messages encrypted.
- Reference: https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543

WhatsApp has 2 new components added in 2023 for key transparency. (Text below copied from https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/)
1. The server (WhatsApp) maintains an append-only AKD of public keys mapped to user accounts.
2. A third-party audit record, wherein any change in the server directory is recorded in a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify.
With these two additions, users can automatically verify their conversation security thanks to the WhatsApp directory. As this is rolled out, security-conscious users who utilize the verify security code page will notice this verification process occurs quickly and automatically. 


Explain how you have used public key cryptography today or yesterday, outside of this homework.
In addition to naming the system, identify how different parties use keys in different steps of the system.
(Answering this question likely requries finding sources on your own. This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

# b) Messaging.
Send an encrypted and signed message using PGP, then verify and decrypt it.
(You can use folders to simulate users, or use two computers or two different OS users. Don't use Tero as a name of any party, unless that's your given name.)

# c) Other tool.
Encrypt a message using a tool other than PGP.
Explain how different parties use different keys at different stages of operation.
Evaluate the security of the tool you've chosen.

# d) Eve and Mallory.
In many crypto stories, Eve is a passive eavesdropper, listening on the wire. Mallory malliciously modifies the messages.
Explain how PGP protects against Mallory and Eve. Be specific what features, which use of keys and which flags in the command are related to this protection.
(This subtasks does not require tests with a computer)

# f) Password management.
Demonstrate use of a password manager. What kind of attacks take advantage of people not using password managers? (You can use any password manager, some examples include pass and KeePassXC.)

Chrome webbrowser has build in strong password suggestion and saving. It is helpful for normal user since login in with same account to pc and mobilephone gives access to same vault for passwords.
There is also the downside of having multiple devices where you have logged in so there is a bigger risk to get hacked in one way or the other. The stronger the password, he harder it is to pass by but also to remember. Passwords you keep in your mind tend to be easier to penetrate. There is also bruteforce attacks where leaked and common passwords are logins are ran against eachother to penetrate user login.

# g) Done
It should also have references to any other source used, such as web pages, LLMs, man pages, other reports...
References are mandatory, and must be present in every report. (This subtask does not need a report, you can just do it and write "Done." as the answer for this subtask.)
